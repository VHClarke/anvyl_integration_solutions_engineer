# Anvyl Integration Solutions Engineer Technical Exercise

#### 1) Anvyl allows you to create suppliers via API, please create a supplier called “[Your name]’s supplier” and provide us the supplier ID. 

#### 2) Anvyl also allows you to create parts via API, please create a part called “[Your Name]’s 32oz bottle” with SKU number = A002468. Provide us the part ID that you just created.

#### 3) Can you add in two tags (summer21, new) for the part and connect the part to the supplier you just created?

#### 4) A new startup that focuses on making different water bottles would like to issue a purchase order for the 32oz bottle that you just created. They’d like to order 20,000 bottles at $0.80/bottle price point, can you create and issue a purchase order via API for them? What’s the PO ID? 

#### 5) After issuing the purchase order, there is a supply chain crisis so you have to increase the price for these bottles to $1.2/bottle. Can you update the price in the purchase order?
